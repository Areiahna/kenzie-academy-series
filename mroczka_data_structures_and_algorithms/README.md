## Video Intro to Homework
Please view a quick video [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c8gjspj9n5areoj/Kenzie%20Academy%20Homework%20Review.mp4?dl=0) on how to get started with the homework.

## Homework Overview
The homework is broken into three parts. Only one of the last two graph questions is required, both are encouraged, but optional:
1) **Big-O Questions** - This involves determining the appropriate Big-O given different functions.
2) **Trees** - A single tree question, based on the workshop. Don't hesitate to reference the `minimum_height_of_binary_tree.py` for help.
3) **Graphs** - Two graph questions, but you only have to pick one to try. Minesweeper tends to be the harder one for most folks.

## Submission Instructions
To submit homework for this assignment, please fill out the `homework.py` file to the best of your ability.

Once you have the `homework.py` file filled out, please [upload it as a github gist](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/creating-gists) for me to review then simply send me the link. Only send the link to the gist, please.
_**Please**_ do not send me file attachments or an email with raw code in it, as it becomes impossible to match proper indentation and get the file working. Just send the direct link to the [gist](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/creating-gists).
